# Apartment Site Study

## Purpose
This project explores the spatial characteristics of a multi-building apartment complex
to understand existing conditions and identify potential improvements.

This is a learning-focused GIS project intended to demonstrate spatial thinking,
data handling, and clear documentation using QGIS.
