# Apartment Site Study

## Purpose
This project explores the spatial characteristics of a multi-building apartment complex
to understand existing conditions and identify potential improvements.

This is a learning-focused GIS project intended to demonstrate spatial thinking,
data handling, and clear documentation using QGIS.

---
## Primary Question
How do terrain, pedestrian infrastructure, and environmental comfort factors
influence walkable access from my apartment complex to nearby daily-use destinations?
---
## Secondary Questions
- Which walking routes minimize physical effort (slope) while maintaining reasonable distance?
- Where do environmental comfort factors (e.g., lighting presence, noise proxies, openness)
  align or conflict with walkability?
- How does parking layout and internal circulation affect pedestrian access to exits
  and nearby destinations?
---
## Study Area
- Type: Multi-building apartment complex
- Location: Approximate (not exact)
- Access: Freely walkable and observable on foot

---
## Scope (Included)
- Walkable paths and informal pedestrian routes
- Terrain and slope as movement constraints
- Relative proximity to nearby conveniences and event spaces
- Observed environmental comfort proxies
---
## Out of Scope (Explicitly excluded)
- Legal accessibility or ADA compliance analysis
- Safety certification or risk assessment
- Property management or development recommendations
- Vehicular traffic engineering
---
## Data Expectations
Planned data types may include:
- Raster data (e.g., elevation-derived surfaces)
- Vector data (e.g., buildings, paths, boundaries)
- Observational notes collected on site

All data limitations and uncertainty will be documented.

---
## Intended Outputs
- One or more clear map layouts
- Written interpretation of findings
- Documentation of assumptions and uncertainty

---
## Status
Question defined.
