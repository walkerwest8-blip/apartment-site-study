# Apartment Site Study

> A learning-focused GIS case study using QGIS  
> Terrain, access, and walkability context analysis

---

## Overview

This project explores the spatial characteristics of a multi-building apartment complex to understand existing conditions and identify potential improvements to pedestrian walkability.

The goal is to demonstrate spatial thinking, data handling, and clear documentation using QGIS.

## Research Questions

### Primary Question
How do terrain, pedestrian infrastructure, and environmental comfort factors influence walkable access from my apartment complex to nearby daily-use destinations?

### Secondary Questions
- Which walking routes minimize physical effort (slope) while maintaining reasonable distance?
- Where do environmental comfort factors (e.g., lighting presence, noise proxies, openness) align or conflict with walkability?
- How does parking layout and internal circulation affect pedestrian access to exits and nearby destinations?

## Scope

### Included
- Walkable paths and informal pedestrian routes  
- Terrain and slope as movement constraints  
- Relative proximity to nearby daily-use destinations  
- Observed environmental comfort proxies  

### Explicitly Excluded
- Legal accessibility or ADA compliance analysis  
- Safety certification or risk assessment  
- Property management or development recommendations  
- Vehicular traffic engineering

## Data

Planned and current data types include:
- Raster data (elevation-derived surfaces such as DEM and slope)
- Vector data (study extent boundaries, buildings, paths)
- Observational notes collected on site

All data limitations and uncertainty are documented.
