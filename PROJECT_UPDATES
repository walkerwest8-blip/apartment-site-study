## Project Update Log

### Session 1 — Terrain Foundation  
**Date:** 2025-12-17  
**Focus:** Establish baseline terrain context for walkability analysis

**Completed:**
- Established project coordinate reference system (EPSG:2240, feet-based)
- Created a non-identifying reference point for spatial context
- Defined a 3.5-mile study extent for neighborhood-scale analysis
- Processed and clipped USGS 1/3 arc-second DEM to study extent
- Derived slope raster (degrees) to represent relative walking effort
- Exported initial slope context map for visualization and documentation

**Notes / Limitations:**
- DEM resolution (~10 m) supports neighborhood-scale analysis only
- Slope surface is used for relative effort context, not ADA or safety compliance
- No network, routing, or destination analysis performed at this stage

**Outputs:**
- `data/processed/boundaries/study_extent_3p5mi.gpkg`
- `data/processed/terrain/dem_2240_clipped.tif`
- `data/processed/terrain/slope_deg_2240.tif`
- `outputs/maps/Session1_slope_context.png`
